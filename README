The eZ Publish extension Batchtool...

This is a command line utility to do the same operations on lots of 
selected objects/nodes. For instance to move, copy or delete a bunch of
nodes. It is based on filters that fetches the objects to operate on, 
utilizing the fetch functions in eZ Publish for a flexible selection of 
objects.

This is intended as a command line tool, allthough I've set it up as a 
cronjob in case that could come in handy for some tasks.
